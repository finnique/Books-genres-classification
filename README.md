## Book Genre Classification

**To-do List:** 
- [ ] Data analysis
  - [x] General statistics
  - [ ] Emotion analysis for title and summary
  - [ ] Topic modeling for summary
- [x] Evaluation methods (from scratch)
- [ ] Naive Bayes Model
  - [ ] Naive Bayes I (from scratch)
    - [ ] setting 1: predict from title
    - [ ] setting 2: predict from summary
    - [ ] setting 3: predict from title + summary
  - [ ] Naive Bayes II (scikit)
    - [ ] setting 1: predict from title
    - [ ] setting 2: predict from summary
    - [ ] setting 3: predict from title + summary
  - [ ] Analysis: Naive Bayes I vs Naive Bayes II
- [ ] Neural Network Model (TBA)

### Introduction

**Task:**
Predicting book genre (fantasy, thriller, science, history, horror, crime, romance, psychology, sports, travel) from title and/or summary.

**Motivations:** \
  To explore and compare different modeling approaches and settings:
  1. Naive Bayes from scratch vs Naive Bayes from scikit
  2. Statistical model vs Neural Network model
  3. With or without Additional features i.e., emotion analysis, topic modeling

### Dataset
[Book Genre Prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/athu1105/book-genre-prediction) from Kaggle


### Models
1. Naive Bayes from scratch
2. Naive Bayes from scikit
3. Neural Network
