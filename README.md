### Introduction

**Task:**
Predicting book genre (fantasy, thriller, science, history, horror, crime, romance, psychology, sports, travel) from title and/or summary.

**Motivations:** \
  To explore and compare different modeling approaches and settings:
  1. Naive Bayes from scratch vs Naive Bayes from scikit
  2. Statistical model vs Neural Network model
  3. With or without Additional features i.e., emotion analysis, topic modeling

### Dataset
[Book Genre Prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/athu1105/book-genre-prediction) from Kaggle


### Models
1. Naive Bayes from scratch
2. Naive Bayes from scikit
3. Neural Network

### Additional Features
1. [Emotion classifier from text](https://huggingface.co/michellejieli/emotion_text_classifier)
